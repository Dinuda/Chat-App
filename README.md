# RealTime Chat-App using NODEJS

## Run application

1.  Using node

        npm start

    NODE.JS mst be installed to run this application as this depends on the JavaScript runtime environment that achieves low latency and high throughput by taking a “non-blocking” approach to serving requests. In other words, Node. js wastes no time or resources on waiting for I/O requests to return.

2.  Using nodemon

        npm run dev

    NODE.JS mst be installed to run this application as this depends on the JavaScript runtime environment that achieves low latency and high throughput by taking a “non-blocking” approach to serving requests. In other words, Node. js wastes no time or resources on waiting for I/O requests to return.
